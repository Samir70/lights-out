This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is my attempt to recreat the old lights out game

Click a light (red button). It will toggle the on/off status of that light and the lights above/below, left/right of that button. The aim is to turn all the lights off.

The level rating of the puzzles is my subjective opintion.

Current state and start position are displayed so I can see what's going on as I develop the project. I can also copy and paste the current position to add another position into the database of challenges.
